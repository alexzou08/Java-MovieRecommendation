This is a website which would make customized movie recommendations based on the average ratings that a movie receives. The recommendation finds users in the database that have similar ratings and weighting their input to provide a more personal recommendation for the users of the website. This could give users recommendations tailored to their own interests and tastes!

## Code design

Build a recommender will focus on making simple recommendations based on the average ratings that a movie receives.
Use interfaces to rewrite existing code, making it more flexible and more efficient.
Use the AllFilters class to combine asking questions about average ratings by length of film in minutes and directors.
Find users in the database that have similar ratings and weighting their input to provide a more personal recommendation for the users of the program.
Make the program more efficient with a RaterDatabase class that is designed and implemented similarly to the MovieDatabase class.
A HashMap named ourRaters that maps a rater ID String to a Rater object that includes all the movie ratings made by this rater. 

## Tech Stack
* Sorting and searching 
* Database
* Interfaces, filters
* Optimize the code by refactoring
